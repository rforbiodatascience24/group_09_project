# Retrieve original data

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library('httr')
library('jsonlite')
```


This first thing to do is acquire the dataset which is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/antaresnyc/human-metagenomics). We check if the dataset is already present, if it is not, we collect it programmatically from kaggle and save it in the \_raw folder.

```{r}
target_dir <- "../_raw/"
wanted_file <- "abundance.csv"
  
# check if the file is already present 
already_present <- file.exists(str_c(target_dir, wanted_file))

if (already_present) {
  message(str_c("The dataset file is already present. Check ", target_dir))
} else {
  # Define the Kaggle dataset path and download location
  dataset_slug <- "antaresnyc/human-metagenomics"
  output_file <- "../_raw/human_metagenomics.zip"
  
  # Dowload the dataset from kaggle
  response <- GET(
    url = str_c("https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/", dataset_slug),
    write_disk(output_file)
  )
  
  # Unzip the downloaded file
  unzip(output_file, exdir = target_dir)
  
  # Get list of files in the directory 
  extracted_files <- list.files(target_dir, recursive = TRUE)

  # Delete files we don't care about
  files_to_delete <- setdiff(extracted_files, wanted_file)
  map(files_to_delete, ~ {
    file_path <- file.path(target_dir, .x)
      file.remove(file_path)})
}
```
