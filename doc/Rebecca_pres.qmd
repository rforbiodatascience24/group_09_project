### HDL Notes

HDL, commonly referred to as "good" cholesterol, is known to be lower in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This reduction increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Other documented factors that contribute to lower HDL levels include certain medications used to treat type 2 diabetes and being overweight. In our analysis, HDL was identified as a statistically significant parameter. The distribution plot shows a clear shift to the left, indicating lower HDL values in this group.

### Hemoglobin A1C Notes

Hemoglobin A1C is a key measure that reflects the average plasma glucose concentration over the previous 10–12 weeks. A value above 48 mmol/mol is a strong indicator of type 2 diabetes. In our analysis, Hemoglobin A1C was also statistically significant. The distribution plot highlights that 34% of individuals with type 2 diabetes had values exceeding 48 mmol/mol, whereas the other two groups had 0% above this threshold.

### BMI Notes

BMI is often considered a statistically significant predictor of diabetes. However, in our study, we did not observe the same correlation. Instead, waist circumference emerged as a noteworthy parameter. These two measures are somewhat correlated, as shown in the analysis.

### GAD Antibodies Notes

GAD (Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase) antibodies are typically associated with type 1 diabetes. As expected, this parameter is not statistically significant in our analysis of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, this pattern holds consistently across different BMI classes, reinforcing its lack of relevance in type 2 diabetes contexts.

### C-Peptide Notes

C-peptide is a 31-amino-acid sequence that connects the A and B chains of proinsulin. It is cleaved during insulin production, making its levels a key marker to differentiate between insulin-producing (type 2 diabetes) and non-producing (type 1 diabetes) patients. Higher levels of C-peptide in type 2 diabetes patients indicate that the body is producing more insulin to compensate for elevated blood sugar levels.

### Fasting Insulin Notes

As expected, patients with type 2 diabetes tend to have higher levels of fasting insulin due to insulin resistance. This was confirmed in our analysis, where fasting insulin was identified as a statistically significant parameter.
