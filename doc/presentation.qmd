### HDL Notes

HDL, commonly referred to as "good" cholesterol, is known to be lower in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This reduction increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Other documented factors that contribute to lower HDL levels include certain medications used to treat type 2 diabetes and being overweight. In our analysis, HDL was identified as a statistically significant parameter. The distribution plot shows a clear shift to the left, indicating lower HDL values in this group.

### Hemoglobin A1C Notes

Hemoglobin A1C is a key measure that reflects the average plasma glucose concentration over the previous 10–12 weeks. A value above 48 mmol/mol is a strong indicator of type 2 diabetes. In our analysis, Hemoglobin A1C was also statistically significant. The distribution plot highlights that 34% of individuals with type 2 diabetes had values exceeding 48 mmol/mol, whereas the other two groups had 0% above this threshold.

### BMI Notes

BMI is often considered a statistically significant predictor of diabetes. However, in our study, we did not observe the same correlation. Instead, waist circumference emerged as a noteworthy parameter. These two measures are somewhat correlated, as shown in the analysis.

::: notes
-   Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are similar in the features showed before, but very different in other characteristics

-   lets have a look at GAD antibodies, C-peptide and fasting insulin levels

### GAD Antibodies Notes

- GAD (Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase) antibodies with glucose tolerance grouped by BMI
- not statistically significant in our analysis of type 2 diabetes
- typically associated with type 1 diabetes. (autoimmunity target GAD and beta cell of pancreas)
- Same for the BMI classes (hence not relevant in type 2 diabetes)

Relevant image: `07_gad_ab_vs_bmi_glucose_tolerance.jpg`

### C-Peptide Notes

- C-peptide concentration with glucose tolerance grouped by BMI
- C-peptide differentiate t1 and t2 diabetes since it is cleaved during insulin production (insulin is only produced in t2)
- Higher levels of C-peptide in type 2 diabetes patients indicate that the body is producing more insulin to compensate for elevated blood sugar levels.
- obese produce more due to increased insulin resistance

% C-peptide is a 31-amino-acid sequence that connects the A and B chains of proinsulin.

### Fasting Insulin Notes

- fasting insulin levels for each glucose tolerance group
- t2 diabetes have higher levels of fasting insulin due to insulin resistance
- statistically significant parameter.

::: notes
### Statin Notes
- Cholesterol level for each glucose tolerance group, grouped by on statins yes/no
- Statins inhibit an enzyme essential for cholesterol production in the liver 
- Statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular related events such as heart attack, stroke, and death due to CVD.
- regardless the glucose tolerance
% - Statins inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, 

### inuslin Notes
-  fasting insulin is not affected by statin, 
- but cholesterol level is lowered by statin
- Hence statins are no diabetes medication
